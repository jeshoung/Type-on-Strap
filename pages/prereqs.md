# Prerequisite Skills

Data science at it's core is mostly applied statistics and mathematics. In order to properly use and interpret a lot of code and output you'll need some background in statistics and probability. Calculus and linear algebra are helpful too. A background in computer science or programming is helpful but not essential, though you will need basic familiarity with file storage, installing programs, etc.

If you have never taken a statistics class before (or if it's been a while), fear not! The internet is full of helpful guides and resources to get you started.

If you would like to take courses organized into a logical path, the [Open Source Society University's Data Science program](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) is a great resource.
