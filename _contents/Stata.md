Stata is a private software for data management, analysis, and visualization. Since it is privately owned and developed it costs money to use, but the intuitive functions, high-quality support guides, and capacity for managing large datasets can be worth it for some fields. 

Stata is a standard program for most social scientists (economists, sociologists, demographers, etc) due to its specialization in survey data analysis. Its interactive "point-and-click" menus can also make analysis and plotting easier for beginners.

Since Stata isn't open source there is not as large of a package environment as with Python or R but it is possible to install user-made programs. Stata does not tend to support multiple datasets, spatial data, or machine learning methods as much as Python or R.
