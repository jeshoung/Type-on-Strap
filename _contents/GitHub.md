### [GitHub Website](https://github.com/)
### [Git Website](https://git-scm.com/)

GitHub is primarily a file hosting and version control site that allows users to host publicly accessible projects and accept feedback in a controlled way. Git is the underlying language of GitHub but also a standalone system in its own right. You don't need to know Git to use GitHub but if you want to access its full potential we recommend it. One of the slightly more advanced but infinitely useful things GitHub can do is host free websites for your resume, project, or research using relatively simple markdown format.
