## [R Project Website](https://www.r-project.org/)
## [RStudio Website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

R is an open-source programming language used by a wide variety of scientists for data management, analysis, and visualization. It offers a large community of users and an array of user-created packages (which provide functions for everything from web applications to machine learning).

RStudio is the most common user-interface for R. Without it, R programmers used to code directly from the command line. RStudio makes it easy to create and edit R-scripts, manage files, view plots, and much more. 

We highly recommend that you install both (RStudio won't work without R) and start off in the RStudio environment.

## General Resource Guides
[RStudio: Resources](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/) - The wonderful folks at RStudio collected resources for downloading and installing R and RStudio, starting out learning R, and special guides for Shiny and R Markdown. A great place to start.

[Open Source Data Science Masters: R Guide](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go/blob/master/r-resources.md) - A comprehensive collection of resources for R from the [OSDM](http://datasciencemasters.org/) folks, who also have a great guide for baseline data skills and Python.

## Complete Tutorials
[R-Statistics.co: R Tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/R-Tutorial.html) - Concise written introduction to R programming with example code by Selva Prabhakaran. Further tutorials available for everything from plotting to regression and time series!

[Data Camp: Data Scientist with R Career Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r) - Over 23 interactive tutorials for all things data science in R! DataCamp offers some free courses but most require a premium account for $29 per month. If you're okay with paying for high-quality courses and don't want to search around for different guides, DataCamp has everything in one place.

[UC Business Analytics with R](http://uc-r.github.io/) - University of Cincinatti's Business School has an excellent set of tutorials for all things R, produced by @bradleyboehmke. Includes everything from an intro bootcamp to predictive analytics with machine learning.

## Beginner's Guides
[Udemy: R Programming A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/r-programming/) - Interactive video course from the SuperDataScience Team for basic programming in R. Usually $12 for the complete course (Udemy has "sales" almost every day and lots of great courses).

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: R Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals) - GitHub repo containing template .Rmd scripts for introductory R programming. To start learning, download the repo as a .zip file using the "Clone or Download" button in green at the top right. Extract the folder and open the "R Fundamentals Part 1 Introduction.Rmd" using RStudio.

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Fast R](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Fast-R) - Consolidated version of the R Fundamentals GitHub repo.

[DataCamp: Free Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) - Basics of R and its data types with 4 hours of video and 62 exercises.

# Intermediate Guides
[tidyverse Homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/) - If you get the basics of importing and visualizing data, the next step is manipulating data in the tidyverse workflow. Fortunately, the makers of tidyverse have consolidated all their packages in one place, along with a "Learn" tab full of great resources.

[dplyr Homepage](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) - The core of all data wrangling in the tidyverse, a set of R packages that is pretty much essential.

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Data Wrangling (dplyr)](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-wrang) - GitHub repo on cleaning and manipulating data in R with the popular dplyr package. Structured similarly to R Fundamentals. Use the "tutorial.Rmd" file to start learning!

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Data Visualization (ggplot2)](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-graphics) - GitHub repo on making plots in R with the popular ggplot2 package.

[R-Statistics.co: ggplot2 Tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html) - Online guide to using ggplot2 with example code.

[R-Statistics.co: ggplot2 Quick Reference](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-cheatsheet.html) - Helpful reference guide of ggplot2 commands with examples.

[RStudio: ggplot2 Cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) - PDF of almost all ggplot2 commands with options. If you do a lot of diverse plotting, I highly recommend printing it out and keeping it next to your computer!

[Leaflet for R: Maps!](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) - Leaflet is a must have package for creating interactive maps in a tidyverse workflow.
