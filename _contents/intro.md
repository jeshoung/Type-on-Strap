## Collection of online learning sites for data science

## Sites for finding online data science courses:
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - Extensive interactive courses on all subjects, each course around $12
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Free interactive courses from leading universities
* [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) - Large collection of free interactive courses with option for paid certificate
  * Select “Self-Paced” in search to find courses available year-round

* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) - Collection of free courses organized into paths with option for paid “nanodegrees”
* [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - Selection of MIT courses with video-lectures, slides, problems, textbooks, etc
  * Less interactive than other online learning resources but often more comprehensive and always self-paced and free
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Free lessons on computer programming, web development, and data science 
 * Includes courses on HTML, Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and more
* [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) - Selection of data science and coding courses
  * Freemium model with some intro content free, then $29 per month for everything
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Go-to help site for programmers, contains countless useful threads

#### Which online course site is "best"? 
There is no clearly superior platform and many courses are cross-listed on several. Udemy, Coursera, EdX, and FutureLearn are similar and tend to host the largest variety of courses. Udacity is more streamlined into career-oriented paths. Codecademy is more focused on general computer programming and Data Camp is a "gamified" introduction. For a curated list of courses check out the repositories for each language or program in the [rest of the guide](https://data-scholars-discovery.github.io/contents/).

## Full courses
* [Open Source Society University Data Science Course](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) - Exhaustive collection of online resources organized into a one-year open source course

## Textbooks
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf) - One of two textbooks utilized in CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning. Provides application examples in R.
* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Free online textbook covering the fundamental mathematics and methods of deep learning. More theoretical than other guides, best for those that already have experience applying mathematical concepts in programming.
